# Illusory Motion Illusion
## Description:

## Instructions: 

* Stare at any point of the image. 
* Do you see movement? 
* There is in reality no movement, it is a 2D static image.

## What Your Brain Is Doing: 

* Viewing the image with your peripheral vision makes the motion appear more pronounced. Staring fixedly at the image may diminish the sense of movement, but changing your eye position briefly by looking to one side refreshes the effect
* What we do know is that the odd arrangements of luminance-based edges must somehow “artificially” activate motion-detecting neurons in the visual pathways. That is, the particular patterns of luminance and contrast fool the visual system into seeing motion where none exists. 

## Why Its Cool

* The colours have no effect on the motion perceived, they are only there for aesthetics.
* From an evolutionary standpoint, this capability has been a valuable survival asset as an early-warning system to attract your attention—whether to detect prey, predator or mate
