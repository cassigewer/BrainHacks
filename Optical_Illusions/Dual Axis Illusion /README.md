## What Your Brain Is Doing: 

* As the lines twist and turn, they appear to be going in all directions, making it impossible to find which axis the shape is rotating around.
* This spinning shape appears to defy logic by rotating around both the horizontal and vertical axis at the same time! To make things even more confusing, the direction of rotation is also ambiguous. Some visual cues in the video will help viewers change their perception

## Why Its Cool

* This won Best Illusion of the Year for 2019 by the Neural Correlate Society. 
* The idea of creating Dual Axis popped up in Forceâ€™s mind while he was experimenting with Lissajous curves (an equation system which generates complex harmonic action).
