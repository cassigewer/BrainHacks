# Adelson’s Same Color Illusion
## Description:

## Instructions: 

* Debate whether block 'a' and 'b' are the same colours or different.

## What Your Brain Is Doing: 

* Adelson’s Checkers Shadow illusion exploits the mechanisms underlying lightness constancy: our capacity to perceive the lightness (or reflectance) of a surface as invariant, even when the intensity of incident light (the illuminance) is changing at a point or is variable across the surface.
* The illusion makes manifest the mechanism that normally allows us to see the lightness of objects in different illuminats accurately.
* We expect the cylinder to cast a shadow on the checkerboard- and because we are used to compensating for shadows in “real life” we perceive and compensate for the shadow we assume has been created by the cylinder. However, the creator of the image has manipulated the colors and the shadow to give the illusion of the shadow–without there actually being a realistically rendered or predictable shadow. In addition, because we interpret a checkerboard pattern in an expected way (alternating light and dark squares), due to the respective positions of squares A and B, our brains automatically categorize square A as a dark square and square B as a light square, despite their actual color.

## Why Its Cool

* *  In fact, they are both the same. Light, and our perception of light, play a large role when it comes to illusions that we see.
