## What Your Brain Is Doing: 

* Motion Induced Blindness is when stationary visual stimuli disappear as if erased in front of an observer's eyes when masked with a moving background
* Motion-induced blindness (MIB) is a phenomenon in which a small but salient object surrounded by a global moving pattern disappears from visual awareness, only to reappear after several seconds
* The phenomenological properties and the neurophysiology of MIB suggest that it involves both high- and low-level visual processes. At the sensory level, the lack of transient stimulation of the targets may cause decay of the response due to adaptation mechanisms. This occurs all the time, even without the surrounding motion, but the system normally knows not to interpret this decay as a physical disappearance and to fill-in the missing representation across time. However, if there is a hint that suggests otherwise, e.g. with a moving pattern that seems to occlude the static pattern, then the system may interpret the sensory decay as a real disappearance. Thus, MIB may be the result of the interaction between sensory level processes and an interpretation or decisional level process.

## Why Its Cool

* As the phenomenon was discovered so recently, researchers have speculated about whether MIB occurs outside the laboratory, without being noticed as such. Situations such as driving, in which some night drivers should see stationary red tail lights of the preceding cars disappear temporally when they attend to the moving stream of lights from oncoming traffic may be case points.
