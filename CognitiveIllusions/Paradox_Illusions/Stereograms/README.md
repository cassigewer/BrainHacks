# Stereograms 

## Description:

## Instructions: 

* Stare at the centre 
* Relax vision 
* Look 'through' the image 
* it will become a blurry 3D image
* Wait until it focuses into a 2D image.

## What Your Brain Is Doing: 

* Stereograms can be viewed as three-dimensional images by providing two side-by-side views of a three-dimensional scene, rendered from slightly different viewpoints. Stereoscopes facilitate focusing of the eyes depths other than the surface of a two-dimensional stereogram image, allowing the two separate images to overlap in the center of the field of vision
* Once the correct depth is achieved, it may seem to the viewer as if the two images are different due to the horizontal retinal disparities. Then the two images can fuse into a coherent three- dimensional percept where horizontal disparities in the images provide important depth cues.
* Stereograms are created by repeating vertical patterns, textures, and/or objects. The horizontal distance between these repeats determines a parallax (visual displacement). If the width of this parallax is too wide it will strain a viewers eyes. If parallax is too narrow, the viewer will fuse too many vertical displacements at once and see extra layers that may fly in and out of focus: called double fusion.

## Why Its Cool

* ome people see the stereo 3D right away, others require time.  This means basic viewing ability falls within the mean of a curve at best, rather than being alike for everybody. The reality is ease of viewing is seldom predictable when people view stereogram images.
