## What Your Brain Is Doing: 

* The illusion combines two visual effects. First, staring at the picture produces
a negative afterimage, in which the black-and-white pattern is reversed. Second, the
`resolution' of the afterimage is lower than that of the actual image, and so the thin
white lines vanish, making it impossible to see the monkeys. 
* This shows rapid changes in perceptual sensitivity, including the brain's adjustment to brightness
that gives rise to the negative afterimage in the illusion

## Why Its Cool

* This illusion shows the very concept that Charles Darwin coined - 'evolution' and its subsequest adaptation.
